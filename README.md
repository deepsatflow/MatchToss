# MatchToss: A Coin Toss App

## What is it?

MatchToss is an Android application for performing a coin toss.

How often do we go to the field and then ask each other if they have a coin for the toss? This app allows players or umpires to perform the toss without needing a physical coin, simulating the experience of an actual coin toss. This is an app that I would personally use if I couldn't find a coin.
I hope you find it useful and enjoyable too! Happy Tossing!

## Main Features

- Supports animations and sounds to simulate a real-world toss
- Includes a surprise scratch card to reveal the result

## Where to get it

The Android APK file is available at: https://github.com/satishgaurav/cricket-coin-toss/blob/main/MatchToss.apk
